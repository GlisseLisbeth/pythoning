Learning python.

- Used free Udacity course: "[Data Structures and algorithms in Python](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud513) " to understand the basics for a technical interview. You can check code frome quizes at the Udacity folder.

- I am also reading and practicing problems from the book [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850). You can contribute to the original repo [here](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition). Check my solutions at Cracking the coding interview folder.

- I am practicing technical interviews with people around the world in the amazing [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/invt/lYnd8OxxLqI649WvxKNa) platform. Solutions to questions I have been asked are in Pramp folder.

- I am also trying to keep practicing to solve technical questions each day from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and/or [Daily Interview Problem](https://www.techseries.dev/daily). Check my solutions at leetcode-daily_interview_problem folder.

Happy coding! ü§ó üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª
